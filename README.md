## About Me

Hello! I'm Bibarta Kumar Sarkar, a passionate full-stack developer with a journey that began at the age of 10 when I delved into programming as a self-taught enthusiast. My early aptitude for coding caught my father's attention, leading to enrollment in a prestigious online platform that fueled my love for coding. Subsequently, scholarships from renowned developer platforms furthered my educational journey. While my initial interests included drawing and gaming, my mother nurtured my artistic spirit by providing a tablet. Today, as a full-stack developer, I merge artistic flair with technical expertise to craft captivating and user-friendly interfaces. Keeping abreast of the latest web technologies and industry trends is paramount to me, ensuring my work remains innovative. I am proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, TailWindCSS, NextJS, Node.js, Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB, and more. Seeking a full-time role, I aspire to contribute my skills and dedication to help a company achieve its goals. Beyond coding, cricket has been a cherished pastime since my early years, and I actively participate in age-based domestic district cricket tournaments, embodying the spirit of a valuable team player. Aside from my tech pursuits, my love for animals is evident as I find solace and joy in petting and caring for them. I bring a holistic approach to both my professional and personal life, aiming to make meaningful contributions wherever I go.
