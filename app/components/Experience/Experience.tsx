              I led the transformation of Batayon Library's digital platform,
              enhancing user experience and accessibility for children and
              adolescents. Inspired by Batayon's mission to promote a love for
              reading, I developed a responsive website and intuitive UI/UX
              design using Figma. Migrating from Wordpress to a custom-coded
              solution, I optimized usability with tailored features and
              organized an extensive database for easy knowledge access. My work
              contributed to creating a transformative learning space where
              technology and reading joyously converge, enriching the
              educational journey for young minds.
